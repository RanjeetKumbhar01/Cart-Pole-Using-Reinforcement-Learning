# Cart-Pole-using-RL

For more Details check out [OpenAI Gym (cart_pole)](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/)<br><br>
The cartpole problem is an inverted pendelum problem where a stick is balanced upright on a cart. The cart can be moved left or right to and the goal is to keep the stick from falling over. A positive reward of +1 is received for every time step that the stick is upright. When it falls past a certain degree then the "episode" is over and a new one can begin. CartPole can be found in OpenAI Gym's list of trainable environments.<br><br>
